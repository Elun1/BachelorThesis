# BachelorThesis

Python scripts to run jobs from the SpecCPU2006 suite.

Caveats:

  *Don't try to run multiple instances of calculix or tonto.
  
  *Don't run more totaljobs than you have cpu cores

Testing:

  *You need /usr/bin/time 
  
  *Use the bash loops for testing (400.jobA.sh etc)
  
  
See documentation for function descriptions
